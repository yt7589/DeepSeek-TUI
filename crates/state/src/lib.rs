//! Persistent state management for conversation threads, messages, and jobs.
//!
//! The [`StateStore`] is the primary entry point, backed by a SQLite database and an
//! append-only JSONL session index file. It provides CRUD operations for:
//!
//! - **Threads** — conversation metadata, archival, and session indexing.
//! - **Messages** — append-only message storage with tree-structured branching.
//! - **Checkpoints** — named state snapshots for restoring conversation progress.
//! - **Jobs** — background task tracking with status and progress.
//! - **Dynamic tools** — per-thread tool registrations.
