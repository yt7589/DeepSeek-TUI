# Agent Fleet

Agent Fleet is the local-first control plane for durable multi-worker runs. The
initial CLI surface is:

```sh
codewhale fleet init
codewhale fleet run tasks.json --max-workers 4
codewhale fleet status
codewhale fleet inspect <worker-id>
codewhale fleet interrupt <worker-id>
codewhale fleet restart <worker-id>
codewhale fleet stop --all
```

Fleet state is stored under the workspace in `.codewhale/fleet.jsonl`. Worker
logs and adapter logs are stored under `.codewhale/fleet/` and
`.codewhale/fleet-host/`.

## Task Spec

`codewhale fleet run` accepts JSON or TOML. A minimal JSON spec:

```json
{
  "name": "local smoke",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "id": "lint",
      "name": "Lint",
      "instructions": "Run the lint check and report failures.",
      "expected_artifacts": ["log"]
    }
  ]
}
```

Workers are optional. If omitted, CodeWhale creates local worker slots up to
`--max-workers`.

## Host Adapters

The host adapter boundary supports local child processes and explicit SSH
workers. Adapters expose the same operations: start, read status, read bounded
logs, interrupt, restart, stop, and cleanup.

Local workers run as child processes with stdin closed and stdout/stderr written
to bounded fleet host logs. They inherit only a small safe base environment
such as `PATH` and explicitly allowlisted variables.

SSH workers run through the system `ssh` client with `BatchMode=yes` and a
bounded connect timeout. Remote environment variables are sent with OpenSSH
`SendEnv`; values are not embedded in the local ssh argv or fleet logs.

Example SSH worker spec:

```json
{
  "id": "builder-1",
  "name": "Builder 1",
  "host": {
    "kind": "ssh",
    "host": "builder.example.com",
    "user": "codewhale",
    "port": 22,
    "identity": "~/.ssh/codewhale_fleet",
    "working_directory": "/srv/codewhale/work",
    "env_allowlist": ["CODEWHALE_PROFILE"],
    "codewhale_binary": "/usr/local/bin/codewhale"
  },
  "capabilities": ["local", "linux", "tests"],
  "max_concurrent_tasks": 1
}
```

Defaults are intentionally conservative:

- no hosted control plane or cloud provisioning is enabled;
- SSH requires an explicit host, working directory, and CodeWhale binary path;
- secret-like environment names such as `TOKEN`, `SECRET`, `PASSWORD`,
  `API_KEY`, and `PRIVATE_KEY` are rejected from adapter allowlists;
- secrets should remain in CodeWhale config providers or remote host config,
  not in task instructions, argv, or fleet logs.
